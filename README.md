# Annoying Cookie Consent

This project simulates a deliberately frustrating and sarcastic cookie consent modal designed to annoy users, much like some real-world examples! It features a modal that displays ridiculous terms and conditions and uses reverse psychology techniques to create an annoying user experience when attempting to decline or accept cookies.

## Features
- A modal that pops up after a short delay, giving you no choice but to interact with it.
- Sarcastic and humorous content, with a playful tone about cookie tracking and data privacy.
- "Decline" button flips positions when hovered over, making it harder to avoid accepting.
- After accepting, it "uploads" user data in a mock process, followed by a funny conclusion.
- Fun, light-hearted UI with playful design elements (colors, fonts, and a "thank you" message to the user).

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS for structure and styling.
- JavaScript to manage modal interactions and form submission behavior.
- Google Fonts (Roboto) for typography.
